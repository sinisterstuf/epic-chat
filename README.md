*A fairly lame TCP chat server in Javascript.*

Based on a video tutorial for writing a TCP server in Node.js, I just added a couple more features.

Usage
-----

Start the server with `npm start` then connect by tcp, e.g. from the same machine: `telnet localhost 1333`.
The port number can be changed in `config.json`.
